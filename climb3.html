            <h2 class="title">BOUDERING, TOP-ROPING OR LEADING </h2>
            <p>
                If you’re interested in learning how to climb, or you’re looking to amp up your climbing strength and skills, joining a climbing gym is a great way to go.

             </p>

             <p> But, indoor climbing it is not only just for beginers. Сlimbing is true sport with competitions different level and in different kind. Also, climbing is in the Olympics for the first time ever, the Sport Climbing event at Tokyo in 2021. Lead Climbing, Bouldering, and Speed Climbing are the three categories, with climbers needing to place well in all three for a medal.</p>


             <h2 class="title">TOP-ROP AND SPEED </h2>

             <p>The tall walls with the ropes on them are top roping walls. That is to say, you start out with the rope pre-placed on top. Top roping arguably is the safest kind of climbing and a great place to start as a beginner. You’ll have to overcome the fear factor of being up high off the ground, but that largely comes down to trusting the gear and your belayer (the partner who is securing you in case you fall, and who will lower you when it’s time to come down).
              </p>
              <p>
              Speed climbing is one form of indoor rock climbing where athletes compete for the fastest time to the top of the climbing wall. The competition takes place on a standardized climbing wall, and the same holds and route are used each time for consistency across competition. There are athletes that train specifically for these events and for international speed climbing competitions. If that's all you know, then you'll be able to watch speed climbing competitions and follow along, but beyond that there is plenty more to speed climbing than meets the eye. Here are the basics that you need to know to be in the know about speed climbing.
             </p>
             <h2 class="title">BOULDERING IN THE GYM</h2>

             <p> One of the most popular such types is bouldering. Requiring neither a harness nor a rope, bouldering involves routes that are close to the ground. A thick crash pad acts as a protective mat below you. Some gyms also require spotters, people who help prevent falls from injuring your head and neck. 
                Bouldering is a great way to build skill because you can focus solely on using your strength and balance to keep yourself on the wall. Novices appreciate the simplicity of it; skilled climbers like the challenge of more difficult routes.
