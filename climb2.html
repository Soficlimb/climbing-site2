     <h3 class="title"> LEAD-CLIMBING</h3>
        <p>
            Lead climbing primarily refers to climbing with a rope and clipping in to fixed protection along the route to protect from a fall. Lead climbing is a form of sport climbing, which is where bolts are drilled into the rock. Climbers have quickdraws attached to their harness, clipping one side to the bolt and the other to the rope.
            Lead climbing can be done outdoors or indoors. Indoors the quickdraws are already pre-hung, safety checked, with the bolts are only around a meter apart. Outdoors you place your own quickdraws and the bolts might be two or three meters apart. The bolts might also be old, rusted, or placed incorrectly so you make the ultimate decision on if you trust them.

        <h3 class="title">BOULDERING ON THE ROCKS</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most popular such types is bouldering.
         Bouldering is rock climbing stripped down to its raw essentials. Leaving behind ropes and harnesses and just using climbing shoes and a bag of chalk over safety mats, your challenge is to climb short but tricky bouldering "problems" (a route, or sequence of moves) using balance, technique, strength, and your brain. You don't need experience or lots of expensive kit to have a go - making it really easy to get into if you've never tried it before.

        <h3 class="title">  DEEP WATER SOLO (DWS)</h3>
        <p>  
        As well there is such a type as Deep Water Solo .DWS is a type of climbing that takes place over a deep body of water which can protect free climbers from high falls.
